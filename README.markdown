# CodeRack

This is an open-source version of the [CodeRack](http://coderack.org) middleware directory which evolved from the
site that hosted the CodeRack contest organized by [Lunar Logic Polska](http://lunarlogicpolska.com) in 2009.

## What's it all about?

CodeRack is a searchable directory of Rack middlewares. Upload, search, rate, or simply browse the collection.

CodeRack is entirely a volunteer effort from the team at Lunar Logic Polska &ndash; so bear with us as we work on this!
Our aim is that the site will be useful for the whole community &ndash; Rack is a beautiful thing and we want to spread
the word and be your number one destination for Rack middlewares.</p>

## What is Rack?

Don't know what Rack is? From Rack documentation:

> Rack provides a minimal, modular and adaptable interface for developing web applications in Ruby. By wrapping HTTP
> requests and responses in the simplest way possible, it unifies and distills the API for web servers, web frameworks,
> and software in between (the so-called middleware) into a single method call.

If you're a serious Ruby developer we recommend to [read more](http://rack.rubyforge.org/)
[about Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/).
